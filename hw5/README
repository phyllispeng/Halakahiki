TODO:

Can I introduce additional verbs to handle the progress of the upload/download? For example,
Send UPLOAD Verb
Receive confirmation that can upload via DAOLPU
Begin upload:
Loop:
Send UPLOAD_2 Verb with x bytes
Wait for DAOLPU_2 Verb confirmation that data was accepted; otherwise, an ERR message
Show progress of upload
Repeat until entire file sent

Since we will be testing your program with your server for these functions,
I will allow you to do this, but you must specify in your README,
the specification for the added verb and the reasons WHY it was necessary to add it.
